wordpress-remote-post
=====================

Manage posting to multiple wordpress sites

History
-------

This was an old project of mine called guestblognetwork.com. Basically a central location to manage all my wordpress websites across class C hosts. I'm currently moving all the code to this repo and updating it to be more coder friendly. If you are interested in this project, feel free to contact me or send a pull request.

Status
------

Initial project setup - by no means is this ready!!! I'll keep you posted.
